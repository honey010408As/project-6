### 1. In a bowl take ½ cup idli rice or parboiled rice along with ½ cup regular rice. Instead of adding regular rice, you can also make the dosa with a total of 1 cup idli rice.

### 8. Add ⅔ to ¾ cup water and grind till you get a fine grainy consistency of rice in the batter. A smooth consistency of the batter is also fine. If the mixer gets heated up, then stop and wait for some minutes. When the mixer cools down, grind again. Depending on the jar capacity, you can grind everything once or in two batches.

### 9. Now take the batter in a large bowl or pan. In case the dosa batter becomes thin, then add a few tablespoons of rice flour to thicken it. Mix the rice flour very well in the batter.

### 10. Add ½ teaspoon rock salt. Mix very well. Instead of rock salt, you can use non-iodized salt or sea salt crystals or himalayan pink salt. Cover and allow to ferment for 8 to 9 hours or more. Time of fermentation will vary depending on the temperature conditions. In winters, the time of fermentation can go up to 14 to 24 hours

### 11. The sada dosa batter after 11 hours. A proper fermentation will double or triple up the volume of the batter with a light sour aroma.

## Step 3 - Making Sada Dosa from Dosa Batter

### 1. Heat a cast iron pan. When the pan becomes hot, spread ¼ to ½ teaspoon oil all over the pan. Do keep the flame on low to low-medium flame, so that you are easily able to spread the batter. If the pan base is very thick, then keep the flame to medium. For a low fat option, just make the dosa without any oil.

### 2. Now take a ladle full of the dosa batter. Pour the batter and gently spread the batter starting from the center and moving outwards.

### 4. Cook the dosa on a low to medium flame. Do regulate the flame as per the pan size and thickness. You can even cover the dosa with a lid and let it get cooked from the base.
